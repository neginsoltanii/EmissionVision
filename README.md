# Emission Vision
## _What if knowing the past, can change the future?_

## Introduction
Emission Vision is a digital twin implemented in mixed reality and designed to provide an interactive and collaborative way of analyzing global CO2 emissions data and each country's contribution. Over the years, CO2 emissions have steadily climbed and continue to rise. Consequently, it is crucial for policymakers and environmental analysts to provide accurate projections based on data patterns. By integrating real-world environmental data into a 3D visualization, Emission Vision enables users to better explore, analyze, and compare the complex trends of CO2 emissions ratio around the world over time. Users can easily compare countries' contributions, gain insights from the data, and collaborate in real-time, allowing analysts to work together to address global environmental challenges.

# Unity-SharedSpatialAnchors

Unity-SharedSpatialAnchors was built to demonstrate how to use the Shared Spatial Anchors API, available in the Meta XR Core SDK for the Unity game engine.

The sample app showcases:
- Spatial Anchor Creation, Saving, Loading, and Sharing
- Scene Sharing
- Automatic Colocation
- Passthrough Avatars

This app uses Photon Unity Networking to share anchor data and support interaction with networked objects in a colocated space.

This codebase is available both as a reference and as a template for a project that utilizes shared spatial anchors. Unity-SharedSpatialAnchors is under the license found [here](LICENSE) unless otherwise specified.
